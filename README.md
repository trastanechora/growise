# Pi Project

> A project about Quotes, to make up your days :)

This is a personal project of mine, the app is intended to show random quotes that is currently displayed in Bahasa Indonesia. I hope this app could help people killing their time with some meaningful words and prevent some people for getting deeper into their depression.

This app is powerded by NuxtJS. Any suggestion and contribution is welcome.
